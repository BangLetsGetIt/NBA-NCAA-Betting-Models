## 📊 Model Parameter Comparison

| Parameter | NBA Model | College Model | Reason for Difference |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Home Court Advantage** | 2.5 pts | 3.5 pts | College crowds are more impactful, smaller venues create intense atmospheres |
| **Recent Form Weight** | 30% | 35% | College teams are more volatile, recent performance is more predictive |
| **Season Stats Weight** | 70% | 65% | Shorter college season means less data, more emphasis on current form |
| **Home/Away Splits** | 50% | 55% | College teams show stronger location-based performance variations |
| **Spread Bet Threshold (Display)** | 2.0 pts | 2.5 pts | College lines are less efficient, need bigger edge to overcome juice |
| **Total Bet Threshold (Display)** | 3.0 pts | 4.0 pts | College scoring is more volatile, requires larger edge |
| **Confident Spread Tracking** | 3.0 pts | 4.0 pts | Higher bar for logging college picks due to increased variance |
| **Confident Total Tracking** | 4.0 pts | 5.0 pts | College totals are harder to predict accurately |
| **Recent Games Analyzed** | 10 games | 8 games | Shorter college season, smaller sample captures momentum better |

## 🎯 Strategic Differences

### NBA Model Strengths
- **More Predictable** - Professional players, consistent performance
- **Better Data** - Official NBA API with detailed stats
- **Tighter Lines** - Market is more efficient, sharper books
- **Lower Variance** - Professional athletes play more consistently
- **Star Power** - Individual players have bigger impact

### College Model Strengths  
- **Market Inefficiency** - Lines are softer, more value opportunities
- **Emotional Betting** - Public overvalues big-name schools
- **Conference Dynamics** - Familiarity breeds predictability
- **Home Court Edge** - Bigger advantage to exploit
- **Mismatch Opportunities** - Wider talent gaps create value

## 💡 Why College Basketball is Sharper for Betting

### 1. **Line Inefficiency**
College basketball has 350+ teams vs NBA's 30. Books can't be as sharp on every line:
- Mid-major games often have stale lines
- Conference games are harder to price correctly
- Less betting volume = less line correction

### 2. **Public Bias**
Recreational bettors overvalue:
- Duke, Kentucky, North Carolina (brand names)
- Recent national championship winners
- Teams in major media markets
- This creates value on their opponents

### 3. **Larger Edges Available**
- NBA: Average value bet edge = 2-3 points
- College: Average value bet edge = 3-5 points
- More games = more opportunities to find mistakes

### 4. **Conference Knowledge**
If you focus on specific conferences:
- Build expertise books don't have
- Understand team matchups deeply
- Spot situational advantages
