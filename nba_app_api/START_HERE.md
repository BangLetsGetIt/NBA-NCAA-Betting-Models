## 💰 The Opportunity

Your NBA model:
- ✅ 60%+ win rate (proven)
- ✅ +25.96 units profit
- ✅ 160+ picks tracked

The app market:
- 🎯 10,000+ people search "NBA picks" daily
- 🎯 5% convert to paid subscriptions (industry standard)
- 🎯 $9.99/month = $500+ revenue at just 50 subs

**Timeline to $5K/month**: 6-12 months with marketing

---

## 🔥 Why This Will Work

1. **You have REAL results** - Not just predictions, actual tracked performance
2. **Full transparency** - Every pick logged with outcome
3. **Premium UI** - Glassmorphism design that feels native
4. **Data-driven** - Appeals to stats nerds (your target market)
5. **Subscription model** - Recurring revenue, not one-time sales

- ❌ Sketchy branding

### Your app:
- ✅ 160+ documented picks
