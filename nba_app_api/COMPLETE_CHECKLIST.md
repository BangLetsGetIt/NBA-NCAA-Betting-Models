## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't use "bet" terminology** → Use "projection" or "analytics"
2. **Don't skip beta testing** → Catch bugs before App Store review
3. **Don't ignore reviews** → Reply to every review (good and bad)
4. **Don't set price too high** → $9.99/mo is the sweet spot
5. **Don't forget analytics** → Track everything (downloads, conversions, churn)
